# DonorsChoose.org Project Approval Prediction

This project aims to address the challenges faced by DonorsChoose.org in screening and approving project proposals by leveraging machine learning techniques. By analyzing the text of project descriptions and other metadata, I aim to predict whether a project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved or not. This will enable DonorsChoose.org to scale their screening process, increase consistency across volunteers, and focus their resources on projects that need the most assistance.

## Problem Statement

DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals annually, and the current manual screening process requires a large number of volunteers to review each submission. With an expected increase in the number of project proposals to 500,000 next year, DonorsChoose.org faces the challenge of scaling their processes and resources to screen projects efficiently. They also aim to improve the consistency of project vetting across different volunteers and focus their attention on applications that require the most assistance.

## Approach

To address these challenges, I have employed the Naive Bayes algorithm for predicting the approval status of project proposals. This algorithm leverages the text of project descriptions and other relevant metadata to make predictions. By training the model on historical data with known approval outcomes, I aim to develop a classifier that can accurately predict whether a project will be approved or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a collection of project proposals submitted to DonorsChoose.org, along with associated metadata such as project descriptions, teacher information, and school details. The dataset is labeled with the approval status of each project proposal, allowing me to train a supervised machine learning model.

## Results and Evaluation

After training the model, I evaluated its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results of the evaluation provide insights into the effectiveness of the Naive Bayes algorithm in predicting the approval status of project proposals.
